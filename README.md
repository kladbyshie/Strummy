# Strummy
Discord music bot

Discord music bot, using Youtube_DL to download music from YouTube and play it in a Discord voice channel. 
Incorporates a queue system, volume controls, a purge command to delete all .webm and .m4a files that are downloaded, and a search command allowing the user to select one of 10 choices to add to the queue

Will soon be expanded with other functionalities as I think of them. 

To use, set up the bot token in the strummy.py file and launch it.
